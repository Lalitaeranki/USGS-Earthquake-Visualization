# USGS-Earthquake-Visualization
Objective: 
 A map using Leaflet  is created that plots all of the earthquakes from USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Here all Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days', based on their longitude and latitude are visualised.
The data markers reflects the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in color.
Also Included are  popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked, legend that will provide context for  map data.
To show the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity, a second data set is included and visualized along side original set of data. Data on tectonic plates can be found at https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates.
Also Added are number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out our two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently and layer controls to our map.
